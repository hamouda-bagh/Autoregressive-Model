# Autoregressive-Model
Signals Modeling using Autoregressive Model

As part of the Signals and Systems Theory module taught in the second year of the engineering degree at Tunisia Polytechnic School, we were asked to work on a mini-project related to time series forecasting. My classmate and I chose to work on the Autoregressive Model in order to forecast new data of an audio sound with white noise.
